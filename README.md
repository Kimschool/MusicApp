# MusicAppProject

This is a prototype of a music app. You can preview the app's interface through the following link:
https://lawrencecha.github.io/musicweb.github.io/ (Sorry, It's not working now. I will fix it later.)

For detailed information about the webpage, please refer to the 'develop' branch. Additionally, you can explore the backend specifics on the 'back' branch.

This project is currently in its prototype stage, so feel free to clone from the branches and make changes. 
Good luck with your modifications!
